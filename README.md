This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, make an account on vercel then request the access.

Make sure MetaMask is installed in your browser with sepolia eth in it (atleast 0.01 is required).
This is required to register to the website and interact with it by creating communitties, polls, vote casting and donations.

Open (https://community-dao-frontend-paqhu08ki-laoyus-projects-7244cb53.vercel.app) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
